Quick GUI built with python Tkinter.  Allows the user to record a short audio sample then convolute the
recorded sample with a set of impulse response signals in a set of venues.  The user can also record a second
audio sample to convolute.  The object is to simulate the recorded audio sample as if it was recorded in the 
chosen venue.
